#Quote Machine

This React project was built as an excercise for the FreeCodeCamp Front End Libraries Certification.
It was created using create-react-app. Axios.js was used to get the data from the API at https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable#get-random-quote.

Special thanks for this API to the fellow camper Luke Peavey.
